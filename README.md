# CustomerSegmentation

# Bank Customer Segmentation Project

This project aims to analyze and segment bank customers based on their transaction behavior using RFM (Recency, Frequency, Monetary) analysis and k-means clustering.
I explore a bank transactions dataset to understand customer behavior and segment them into different groups. The analysis includes data cleaning, exploratory data analysis, and k-means clustering for customer segmentation.


The dataset is on kaggle : https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/shivamb/bank-customer-segmentation
